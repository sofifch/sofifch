Hi there! I'm Sofia - a junior majoring in Computer Science at Georgia Tech :honeybee:. I'm particularly passionate about the design and implementation of computational models of intelligence on artifacts that interact with the physical world. I'm interested in a Software Engineering internship opportunity for Summer 2021, and I'm open to any roles related to full-stack, front-end and back-end development.
